# Complete List of Networking Tools and Equipment

## 🖥️ Networking Hardware
- **Switches** → connect devices in a LAN.
- **Routers** → connect different networks (LAN ↔ Internet).
- **Firewalls (Cisco ASA, Palo Alto, Fortinet, Checkpoint, Sophos)** → protect the network from outside threats.
- **Access Points (APs)** → provide Wi-Fi for employees.
- **Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC)** → manage multiple access points centrally.
- **Network Interface Cards (NICs)** → inside PCs/servers for network connectivity.
- **Patch Panels & Racks** → organize cables neatly in data centers.
- **Load Balancers (F5, Citrix Netscaler, HAProxy, NGINX)** → distribute traffic across servers.
- **VoIP Phones / IP Phones** → internal/external communication via IP.
- **CUCM (Cisco Unified Communications Manager)** → manages VoIP phones and call routing.
- **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)** → backup power for network devices.
- **Cables (UTP, Fiber, Console cables)** → physical connectivity.
- **Modems / Gateways** → connect to ISP.

## ⚙️ Servers / Services
- **DHCP Server** → automatically assigns IP addresses.
- **DNS Server** → translates domain names into IP addresses.
- **Active Directory (AD) / LDAP** → manages users, groups, and permissions.
- **Mail Servers (Microsoft Exchange, Postfix, Zimbra)** → handle company email.
- **File Servers / NAS (Network-Attached Storage)** → store and share company files.
- **Database Servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL, Oracle)** → store structured company data.
- **Web Servers (Apache, NGINX, IIS)** → host websites/applications.
- **Print Servers** → manage and share printers across the network.
- **Virtualization Servers (VMware ESXi, Hyper-V, Proxmox)** → run multiple virtual machines.
- **Backup Servers** → centralize system/data backups.

## 🔒 Security Tools
- **IDS/IPS (Snort, Suricata, Cisco FirePOWER, Palo Alto)** → monitor and block suspicious activity.
- **VPN Gateways (Cisco AnyConnect, OpenVPN, FortiClient)** → secure remote access.
- **RADIUS / TACACS+ Servers** → centralized authentication for network devices.
- **SIEM Systems (Splunk, ELK Stack, QRadar)** → collect and analyze security logs.
- **Endpoint Security (Symantec, McAfee, CrowdStrike)** → antivirus, EDR, endpoint protection.
- **Web Application Firewalls (WAF: ModSecurity, AWS WAF, Cloudflare)** → protect web apps from attacks.
- **2FA / MFA Systems (Duo, Google Authenticator, RSA SecurID)** → strengthen user authentication.

## 🛠️ Software Tools
**Network Monitoring Tools**
- SolarWinds, PRTG, Nagios, Zabbix, Cacti → monitor health, bandwidth, uptime.

**Configuration / Automation Tools**
- Cisco DNA Center, Ansible, Puppet, Chef, SaltStack → automate network configuration and management.

**Remote Access Tools**
- TeamViewer, AnyDesk, RDP, VNC → access systems remotely.
- **SSH Clients:** SecureCRT, PuTTY, MobaXterm, OpenSSH.

**Packet Capture / Analysis**
- Wireshark, tcpdump, Tshark → capture and analyze traffic.

**Collaboration / Documentation Tools**
- Confluence, Notion, Microsoft SharePoint → document networks, configs, processes.
- Git / GitHub / GitLab → version control for scripts and configs.

## 📡 Other Useful Tools & Equipment
- **Cable Testers & Certifiers (Fluke, Klein Tools)** → check if network cables are functional.
- **Tone Generator & Probe Kits** → trace cables in large setups.
- **IP Scanners (Angry IP Scanner, Advanced IP Scanner, Nmap)** → discover active devices on the network.
- **Syslog Servers (Graylog, Kiwi Syslog)** → centralize logs from network devices.
- **SNMP Tools** → manage and monitor devices using SNMP protocol.
- **Network Diagram Tools (Visio, Lucidchart, Draw.io)** → create topology maps.
- **Patch Management Systems (WSUS, ManageEngine, PDQ Deploy)** → keep systems updated.

**Cloud Management Tools**
- AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Console → hybrid/cloud infrastructure.
